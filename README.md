# Git Commands

[Git Tutorial for Beginners - Crash Course](https://academind.com/tutorials/git-the-basics)

## [Git Overwrite master with branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30105210/git-overwrite-master-with-branch)

`git branch -f master dev_branch` will rewrite local master branch.

`git push remote +dev_branch:master` will rewrite remote branch.

***

## Git `main`
Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:

    git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
 
Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
 
    git branch -m <name>

## [How do I properly force a Git push?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509543/how-do-i-properly-force-a-git-push)

Just do:

    git push origin <your_branch_name> --force

or if you have a specific repo:

    git push https://git.... --force

This will delete your previous commit(s) and push your current one.

It may not be proper, but if anyone stumbles upon this page, thought they might want a simple solution...

### Short flag

Also note that `-f` is short for `--force`, so

    git push origin <your_branch_name> -f

will also work.

## [Create Git Aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)

```
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status

git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
```

`git push -u origin froala-editor` *Push branch* to origin (froala-editor)

`git checkout -b modify-README` Switched to a *new branch* 'modify-README'

`git branch -m <oldname> <newname>` *Rename* a branch while pointed to *any* branch

`git branch -m <newname>` *Rename* the *current* branch

`git branch -d the_local_branch` *Delete* local branch

`git commit --amend -m "New commit message"` *Amending* (rename) the most recent *commit message*

`git push <remote> <branch> -f` *Changing* the message of a *commit* that you've *already pushed* to your remote branch

***

## How do I rename a local Git branch?

If you want to rename a branch while pointed to any branch, do:

    git branch -m <oldname> <newname>

If you want to rename the current branch, you can do:

    git branch -m <newname>

A way to remember this, is `-m` is for "move" (or `mv`), which is how you rename files.

***

## [Delete a branch (local or remote)](https://makandracards.com/makandra/621-git-delete-a-branch-local-or-remote)

`git branch -d the_local_branch`
To delete a local branch

`git push origin :the_remote_branch`
To remove a remote branch (if you know what you are doing!)

`git push origin --delete the_remote_branch`
or simply use the new syntax (v1.7.0)

## How to change your Git editor
There are two ways in which this can be done. The first is via the terminal; this is useful if you want your editor to be Nano, for example. The command to do this is `git config --global core.editor "nano"`. You can change the highlighted section with your editor of choice!

Another way to do this is to edit the `.gitconfig` file in your `home` directory. The location of this file depends on the operating system you're using.
